The superior temporal sulcus (STS) encompasses a complex set of regions involved in a wide range of cogni-tive functions. To understand its functional properties, neuromodulation approaches such brain stimulation or neurofeed-back can be used. We investigated whether the posterior STS (pSTS), a core region in the face perception and imagerynetwork, could be specifically identified based on the presence of dynamic facial expressions (and not just on simplemotion or static face signals), and probed with neurofeedback. Recognition of facial expressions is critically impairedin autism spectrum disorder, making this region a relevant target for future clinical neurofeedback studies. We used astringent localizer approach based on the contrast of dynamic facial expressions against static neutral faces plus movingdots. The target region had to be specifically responsive to dynamic facial expressions instead of mere motion and/or thepresence of a static face. The localizer was successful in selecting this region across subjects. Neurofeedback was thenperformed, using this region as a target, with two novel feedback rules (mean or derivative-based, using visual or auditoryinterfaces). Our results provide evidence that a facial expression-selective cluster in pSTS can be identified and mayrepresent a suitable target for neurofeedback approaches, aiming at social and emotional cognition. Thesefindingshighlight the presence of a highly selective region in STS encoding dynamic aspects of facial expressions. Future studiesshould elucidate its role as a mechanistic target for neurofeedback strategies in clinical disorders of social cognitionsuch as autism.
